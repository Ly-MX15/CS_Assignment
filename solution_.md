From 2006 to 2018, the value of WO showed an upward trend, increasing from 205.9 thousand to 280.1 thousand.
However, during the same period, beer consumption in the Netherlands only increased slightly, from 11,402 thousand kilo to 12,048 thousand kilo.
In some years, such as 2008 and 2012, although the value of WO increased, beer consumption decreased slightly. This suggests that other factors may also influence beer consumption.
While both are trending upward, that doesnâ€™t mean there is a correlation between them, and it would be far-fetched to think there is a correlation without other data to support it.
